# Predicting Arrests
Using Crime Data to Predict Case Status

I use the data compiled by BuzzFeed and The Trace (https://www.thetrace.org/violent-crime-data/) to construct a model which predicts, given characteristics of a shooting incident, whether an arrest will be made. Detailed, annotated analysis is in the Crime_Data.ipynb file. I explore and clean the data, select features, test models, and ultimately select an XGBoost model that predicts whether a case will be cleared or not with 72% accuracy based on variables describing the criminal incident.

Data needs to be downloaded and unzipped to reproduce the analysis.
