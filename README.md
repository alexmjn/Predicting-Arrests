# Predicting Arrests
Using Crime Data to Predict Case Status

I use the data compiled by BuzzFeed and The Trace (https://www.thetrace.org/violent-crime-data/) to construct a model which predicts, given characteristics of a shooting incident, whether an arrest will be made. Through predictive modeling, I predict whether a case will be cleared or not with 72% accuracy based on variables describing the criminal incident. Analysis is in the Crime_Data.ipynb file.

Data needs to be downloaded and unzipped to reproduce the analysis.
