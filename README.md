# Predicting-Arrests
Using Crime Data to Predict Case Status

I use the data compiled by BuzzFeed and The Trace (https://www.thetrace.org/violent-crime-data/) to construct a model which predicts, given characteristics of a shooting incident, whether an arrest will be made.

Data needs to be downloaded and unzipped to reproduce the analysis.
